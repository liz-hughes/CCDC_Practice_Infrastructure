# October 16th 2023 Writeup <!-- omit from toc -->
This is a writeup for the aforementioned date above it is organized into the following 
- [Progress](#progress)
- [Observations](#observations)
- [Improvements/Reflection](#improvementsreflection)

## Progress 
T2_Ubuntu1 created and almost updated. Updates took a lot of time so no further work was able to be done.
T2_Ubuntu2 will be created based off a duplicated T2_Ubuntu1 once it is complete.

I conduction review for setting up routers and VPN on Ubuntu VM. I hope to set them up before next monday or during 
the meeting if I need assistance.

## Observations
There was a bit of confusion on where to start, but once we got going we were able to be (decently) productive.

It takes FOREVER to run updates so to maximize efficiency, they should be done before meetings.

## Improvements/Reflection
1.  More communication within team
2.  More "dumb-down" explanation of what is going on, at least to start.
